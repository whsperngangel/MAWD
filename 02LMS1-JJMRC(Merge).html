	        	<p>Greetings! My name is Jynyl Yvryl Kryzyl V. Manalansan. I was born in the year 2005 and currently at the age of 16. 
	        		I don't have a particular hobby but I enjoy playing games, drawing, and writing. I like cats a lot and I would love
	        		to keep a lot of them once I get old. I also like music and I make long playlists on my spotify account. I chose MAWD
	       		 	because I have always been fascinated by computers and I wish to be a web developer in the future.</p>

	        		forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be 
	        		encumbered with your old nonsense.”</i>

				<h1 class="name">Mavi Angel Viranel Caling</h1>
				<p class="bio-mavi">Hi, I'm <strong>Mavi</strong>. First thing you should know about me is I am a shy and quiet person but as long as you approach me we could be friends instantly. If you're wondering if I have any talents, I do have one which is singing. I haven't sung infront of many people yet because I get very nervous. One of my hobbies is playing codm, not to boast but I am quite good at it. During my free time I watch <sub>kdramas</sub> and <sup>kpop</sup>, and because of that I can speak a little bit of korean, this also serves as my <i>coping mechanism</i>. I sometimes consider myself as a funny person because my friends and family says so. And I think thats it, I'd love to become friends with everyone in the future.</p>
