    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Mavi</strong>. First thing you should know about me is I am a shy and quiet person but as long as you approach me we could be friends instantly. If you're wondering if I have any talents, I do have one which is singing. I haven't sung infront of many people yet because I get very nervous. One of my hobbies is playing codm, not to boast but I am quite good at it. During my free time I watch <sub>kdramas</sub> and <sup>kpop</sup>, and because of that I can speak a little bit of korean, this also serves as my <i>coping mechanism</i>. I sometimes consider myself as a funny person because my friends and family says so. And I think thats it, I'd love to become friends with everyone in the future.</p>
